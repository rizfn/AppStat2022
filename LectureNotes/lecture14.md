## Recap

Just an assignment (measuring $g$) recap and excercise discussion

## Calibration

* establishes a relation between a quantity of interest and information
* use this information to correct/improve the estimate on the quantity of interest

If you see a difference for day and night, check how different it is, and then correct for the difference.

### General Considerations

Every research field will have it's own way of doing it, but in general:

* **Using control sample/group:** To ensure there's no inherent bias: a good control sample looks like as the signal
* **Considering results for an already well-determined quantity:** A good control measurement is "easy" and well measured.
* **Determining relation to well measurable quantity:** Infer qantity from something else which can be measured. Example: look for liquid flow rate inside a pipe using a microphone.

C-14 dating is a prime example: It decays exponentially, and is very traceable. But, since after death they don't take any more carbon-14, you can pretty accurately date the death of something.

You have to correct for stuff: for c-14 data, nuclear tests are an important consideration as they create more c-14.

If you have something you want to find a peak in (say, $x$), it might be hard to see. However, if you find another parameter that the peak in $x$ depends on, you can plot that vs $x$ in 2d. Then, you calibrate your experiment using this infomation (i.e, record humidity along with x, and adjust your $x$ values with the humidty adjustment to find $y$).

Again, you establish a functional relation between the two ($x$ and $y$) and you *correct* for that.

You need to think *ahead* of planning your experiment, to know how to calibrate it is. Otherwise, you'll have a big experiment and no idea how it works.

Calibration is essential in order to ensure measurements are correct and correct them if they're biased. They also establish/calibrate uncertainity on measurements.

Being able to calibrate properly distinguishes a good experimenter.
